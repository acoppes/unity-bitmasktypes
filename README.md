# Introduction

The idea with this project is having a way of creating custom enums in editor, by Game Designers for example, and use them internally for fast comparisons as bitmasks.

# Motivation

When working on Iron Marines at Ironhide, we used bitmasks to speed up units' abilities targeting logic. To do that, we were using c# Enums with Flags Attribute, like this:

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum TargetType
{
    Unit = 1 << 0,
    Structure = 1 << 1,
    Vehicle = 1 << 2
}
```

Using this approach, we can configure them in Unity's Editor by selecting the flags we want, and then we just compare using bitwise operations to check if a target matches the ability targeting. 

This works pretty well internally but it has one limitation, it is not so easy for the Game Designers to extend it since they have to know it is used internally as bitmask and they don't care about it.

There is also another problem, extending it by code couples the Enum definition to a specific game instead of keeping the core engine decoupled to be easily reused.

So the focus here is to keep the base concepts coupled to the core engine while leaving the values to the Game Designers, and if they want, different on each game.

## First Approach: Custom types

Right now, each time a new type is created, the asset importer auto assigns a bitmask to that asset. The bitmask itself isn't important in editor, could change and nothing happens since the users of that asset should referencing the asset itself. 

To use it, you have to create a subclass of BaseTypeAsset and start creating your asset instances for each kind of type you need. For example, for a game with different kind of damages:

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName="Gemserk/Example/Damage Type")]
public class DamageTypeAsset : BaseTypeAsset {}
```

Then, in a class you want a bitmask of that type, you can do the following:

```csharp
public class UnitWithDamage : MonoBehaviour
{
    [TypeMask(typeof(DamageTypeAsset))]
    public BaseTypeMask damageTypes;
}
```

Here you declare a field of type BaseTypeMask, and say the type you want is of type `DamageTypeAsset` so the custom property drawer will allow you select the bits you want using an enum mask (internally saves a list of asset references, not the bitmask).

In editor, it looks like this:

<img src="images~/example1.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

### Code autogeneration

For each custom type, a file with an enum with bitmasks is autogenerated when reimporting new type instances, for example: 

```csharp
namespace Gemserk.Examples
{
    public enum DamageTypeAssetEnum
    {       
        ElectricDamage = 1 << 0,   
        FireDamage = 1 << 1,
        IceDamage = 1 << 2,
        PoisonDamage = 1 << 3,
    }
}

```

So this can be used from code directly. This normally isn't needed since we try to configure everything to depend on assets and then use an int, but sometimes this could be handy, maybe for unit tests, or for editor stuff.

The drawbacks of this approach is we have to depend a lot on Unity assets in code, and also having the iteration to calculate the bitmask.

## Second Approach: Custom type names

Another option is to just define your types in a generic way in your code and then use custom attribute to optionally override the names in the inspector. This is a clean an simplier way.

For example, for the following type:

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum ArmorType
{
    Nothing = 0,
    Everything = -1,
    Type0 = 1 << 0,
    Type1 = 1 << 1,
    Type2 = 1 << 2,
    Type3 = 1 << 3,
    Type4 = 1 << 4,
    Type5 = 1 << 5,
    Type6 = 1 << 6,
    Type7 = 1 << 7
}
```

The inspector will normally draw it as:

<img src="images~/example_using_names4.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

In this case, you can create an `EnumNameTypeAsset` asset to override the names, as it follow:

<img src="images~/example_using_names1.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

And then, configure code attribute when using the type:

```csharp
[EnumName("damages")]
public ArmorType type1;
```

That will show this in the inspector:

<img src="images~/example_using_names2.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

One good thinga bout enums approach is you can have type checks in compilation time, so you can't misplace a check between ArmorType and DamageType unless you want it and you have to explicitly specify it.

This works with other enums and even with int fields.

```csharp
[EnumName("damages")]
public int type3;
```

One good thing of using ints is you don't have to worry about defining all the enum entries, while the enums mode will fail if you define more types in the asset than the enum. 

On drawback is you don't any type in code, you just work with ints, so yo delegate the config to the editor all the time. This could be fixed by autogenerating code with static int list for each defined type maybe, like this:

<img src="images~/example_using_names5.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Which will generate this code:

```csharp
namespace Gemserk.Examples
{
    
    public class DamageTypes
    {
        public static int Fire = 1 << 0;
        public static int Ice = 1 << 1;
        public static int Lightning = 1 << 2;
    }
}
```
